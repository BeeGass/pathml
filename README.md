# Installing

## Requirements

* Install [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/download/)  
    * Linux: ``sudo apt-get install openslide-tools``
    * Mac: ``brew install openslide``

* For managing environments, we recommend using Conda. 
    Download Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

## Installation

1. Clone repo

````
git clone https://github.com/Dana-Farber/pathml.git
cd pathml
````

2. Set Up Conda Environment

````
conda create --name pathml
conda activate pathml
````

3. Install CUDA. This step only applies if you want to use GPU acceleration for model training or other tasks. This guide should work, but for the most up-to-date instructions, refer to the [official PyTorch installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

    - Check the version of CUDA:
    
        ````
        nvidia-smi
        ````
    
    - Install correct version of `cudatoolkit`:

        ````
        # update this command with your CUDA version number
        conda install cudatoolkit=11.0
        ````


4. Install PathML

````
conda env update -f environment.yml     # install dependencies
pip install -e .                        # install pathml
````

Optionally verify PyTorch installation with GPU support: `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`

## Generate Documentation

This repo is not yet open to the public. Once we open source it, we will host documentation online.
Until then, you must build a local copy of the documentation yourself.

````
# first install packages for generating docs
pip install ipython sphinx nbsphinx nbsphinx-link sphinx-rtd-theme  
cd docs         # enter docs directory
make html       # build docs in html format
````

Then use your favorite web browser to open ``pathml/docs/build/html/index.html``

## Tests and Code Coverage 

You may optionally run the test suite to verify installation. 

To run tests:  
````
conda install pytest    # first install pytest package
python -m pytest        # run test suite
````
Note that because the testing suite tests all parts of the code base, 
this may require installing additional packages as well. 
(e.g. installation of java is required for some functionality).

You may also optionally measure code coverage, i.e. what percentage of code is covered in the testing suite.

To run tests and check code coverage:
```
conda install coverage  # install coverage package for code coverage
coverage run            # run tests and calculate code coverage
coverage report         # view coverage report
coverage html           # optionally generate HTML coverage report
```

# Getting Started

The [example notebooks](examples) are a good place start with `PathML`.
