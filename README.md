# PathML 

Utilities for working with pathology images, facilitating machine learning for digital pathology.

## Requirements

* Install [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/download/)  
    * Linux: ``sudo apt-get install openslide-tools``
    * Mac: ``brew install openslide``

* For managing environments, we recommend using Conda. 
    Download Miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)


## Installation

````
git clone https://github.com/Dana-Farber/pathml.git     # clone repo
cd pathml                               # enter repo directory
conda env create -f environment.yml     # create conda environment
conda activate pathml                   # activate conda environment
pip install -e .                        # install pathml in conda environment
````

## Generate Documentation

This repo is not yet open to the public. Once we open source it, we will host documentation online.
Until then, you must build a local copy of the documentation yourself.

````
conda install sphinx    # install sphinx package for generating docs
cd docs                 # enter docs directory
make html               # build docs in html format
````

Then use your favorite web browser to open ``pathml/docs/build/html/index.html``

## Getting Started

The [example notebooks](examples) are a good place start with `PathML`.

1. [Building a basic preprocessing pipeline for H&E images](examples/basic_HE.ipynb)
1. [Building a more efficient custom preprocessing pipeline](examples/advanced_HE_chunks.ipynb)
1. [Stain normalization for H&E images](examples/stain_normalization.ipynb)
1. [Nucleus detection for H&E images](examples/nucleus_detection.ipynb)

## Tests and Code Coverage 

You may optionally run the test suite to verify installation. 

To run tests:  
````
conda install pytest    # first install pytest package
python -m pytest        # run test suite
````

You may also optionally measure code coverage, i.e. what percentage of code is covered in the testing suite.

To run tests and check code coverage:
```
conda install coverage  # install coverage package for code coverage
coverage run            # run tests and calculate code coverage
coverage report         # view coverage report
coverage html           # optionally generate HTML coverage report
```
