Creating Preprocessing Pipelines
================================

Preprocessing pipelines define how raw images are transformed and prepared for downstream analysis.
The ``pathml.preprocessing`` module provides tools to define modular preprocessing pipelines for whole-slide images.

In this section we will walk through how to define a
:class:`~pathml.preprocessing.pipeline.Pipeline` object by composing pre-made
:class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform` s, and how to implement a
new custom :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform`.


What is a Transform?
------------------------

The :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform` is the building block for creating preprocessing pipelines.
Each :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform` contains an operation which,
when applied to a :class:`~pathml.core.tile.Tile` object, modifies it in some way.
For example, :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform`s may modify the image (e.g. apply a blur),
create/modify a mask (e.g. tissue detection), or create/modify a label (e.g. binary classification whether the
tile contains any pen marks).

    In this example, several masks are created (represented by stacked rectangles) as well as
    several labels (depicted here as cubes).


What is a Pipeline?
-----------------------

A preprocessing pipeline is a set of independent operations applied sequentially.
In ``PathML``, :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.pipeline.Pipeline` s are defined as a sequence of
:class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform` objects. This makes it easy to compose a custom
:class:`~pathml.preprocessing.pipeline.Pipeline` by mixing-and-matching:

    :alt: schematic diagram of modular pipeline composition
    :scale: 40 %
    :align: center

In practice, this requires only a few lines of code:

.. code-block::

    from pathml.preprocessing.pipeline import Pipeline
    from pathml.preprocessing.transforms import BoxBlur, TissueDetectionHE

    pipeline = Pipeline([
        BoxBlur(kernel_size=15),
        TissueDetectionHE(mask_name = "tissue", min_region_size=500,
                          threshold=30, outer_contours_only=True)
    ])

In this example, the preprocessing pipeline will first apply a box blur kernel, and then apply tissue detection.
It is that easy to compose pipelines by mixing and matching :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform` objects!


Premade pipelines
--------------------

Pre-made Pipelines make it even easier to get up-and-running quickly.

Creating custom Transforms
------------------------------

.. note:: For advanced users

In some cases, you may want to implement a custom :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform`.
For example, you may want to apply a transformation which is not already implemented in ``PathML``.
Or, perhaps you want to create a new transformation which combines several others.

To define a new custom :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform`,
all you need to do is create a class which inherits from :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform` and
implements an ``apply()`` method which takes a :class:`~pathml.core.tile.Tile` as an argument and modifies it in place.
You may also implement a functional method ``F()``, although that is not strictly required.

For example, let's take a look at how :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.BoxBlur` is implemented:

.. code-block:: python

    class BoxBlur(Transform):
        """Box (average) blur kernel."""
        def __init__(self, kernel_size=5):
            self.kernel_size = kernel_size

        def F(self, image):
            return cv2.boxFilter(image, ksize = (self.kernel_size, self.kernel_size), ddepth = -1)

        def apply(self, tile):
            tile.image = self.F(tile.image)


That's it! Once you define your custom :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform`,
you can plug it in with any of the other :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.transforms.Transform`s,
compose :class:`~pathml.preprocessing.pipeline.Pipeline`, etc.
