HDF5 Integration
================

Overview
--------

A single whole-slide image may contain on the order of 10\ :superscript:`10` pixels, making it infeasible to
load entire images in RAM. ``PathML`` supports efficient manipulation of large-scale imaging data via
the **h5path** format, a hierarchical data structure which allows users to access small regions of the processed WSI
without loading the entire image. This feature reduces the RAM required to run a ``PathML`` workflow (pipelines can be
run on a consumer laptop), simplifies the reading and writing of processed WSIs, improves data exploration utilities,
and enables fast reading for downstream tasks (e.g. PyTorch Dataloaders).

How it Works
------------

The internals of ``PathML`` as well as the **h5path** file format are based on the hierarchical data format
`HDF5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format>`_, implemented by
`h5py <https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/>`_.
Each instantiation of :class:`~pathml.core.slide_data.SlideData` contains internal
references to temporary on-disk h5py objects. As tiles are extracted and passed to a preprocessing pipeline, the
processed tiles are then aggregated and stored in the slide's h5py object.
All interaction with h5py is automaticallyhandled by ``PathML`` on the backend by
:class:`~pathml.core.h5manager._h5manager`. For example, ``slidedata.tiles[tile_key]`` returns the tile at
key ``tile_key`` from the h5py file on disk. Note that this command has syntax like an in-memory dict.
At the conclusion of preprocessing, the h5py object can optionally be
written to disk in ``.h5path`` format via the :meth:`SlideData.write() <pathml.core.slide_data.SlideData.write>` method.

``.h5path`` File Format
------------------------

**h5path** utilizes a self-describing hierarchical file system that mirrors 
:class:`~pathml.core.slide_data`. This allows for simple reading and writing
of :class:`~pathml.core.slide_data` objects.

Here we examine the **h5path** file format:

::

    root/
    ├── fields/
    │   ├── name
    │   ├── labels
    │   ├── history
    │   └── slide_backend
    ├── array
    ├── masks/
    │   ├── arraymask1
    │   └── ...
    └── tiles/
        ├── tilesdict
        ├── tilemask1
        └── ...


Objects are saved to **h5path** if they are present in :class:`~pathml.core.slide_data`. 
The file system is organized through ``h5py.Groups``. ``/root/`` is a group, as are ``fields/``,
``masks/``, and ``tiles/``. Groups are container-like and can be queried like dictionaries:

.. code-block::

   import h5py
   root = h5py.File('pathtoh5.h5', 'r')
   masks = root['masks']

Within groups, array-like objects are stored as ``h5py.Dataset`` objects that when accessed return
``numpy.ndArray`` objects. All tiles are stitched together in a single ``h5py.Dataset`` at ``array/``.
A dictionary is maintained at ``tiles/tilesdict`` with coordinates and fields describing each tile.

.. important::

    To retrieve a ``numpy.ndArray`` object from ``h5py.Dataset`` you must slice the Dataset with
    NumPy fancy-indexing syntax: for example [...] to retrieve the full array, or [a:b, :] to
    return the array with first dimension sliced to the interval [a, b].

.. code-block::

   import h5py
   root = h5py.File('path/to/file.h5path', 'r')
   masks = root['masks']
   segmentationmask = masks['segmentationmask'][...]
   segmentationmaskslice = segmentationmask[2,:,:]

Attributes are small named fields attached to ``h5py.Dataset`` and ``h5py.Group`` objects. String,
tuple, and dict type objects are stored as attributes of the ``Group`` or ``Dataset`` they describe.
``name`` and ``labels`` are stored as attributes describing ``fields/``.

.. code-block::

   import h5py
   root = h5py.File('path/to/file.h5path', 'r')
   tile = root['tiles']['tile1']
   tilecoords = tile.attrs['coords']

Reading and Writing
-------------------

:class:`~pathml.core.slide_data.SlideData` objects are easily written to **h5path** format
by calling :meth:`SlideData.write() <pathml.core.slide_data.SlideData.write>`.
All files with ``.h5`` or ``.h5path`` extensions are loaded to :class:`~pathml.core.slide_data.SlideData` objects
automatically by calling :func:`~pathml.core.h5path.read`.
