h5path
======

Overview
--------

``PathML`` supports efficient on-disk manipulation and storage of terabyte-scale imaging data. 

The **h5path** format, based on the hierarchical array store 
`HDF5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format>`_ and utilizing 
`h5py <https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/>`_, enables on-disk, NumPy-style manipulation 
of multi-terabyte arrays. This feature reduces the RAM required to run a ``PathML`` workflow,
improves data exploration utilities and simplifies the reading and writing of processed WSIs.

:class:`~pathml.core.slide_data.SlideData` array-like field :class:`~pathml.core.tiles` contains 
references to temporary on disk h5py objects that can be optionally saved or are automatically 
deleted when their reference is lost. 

Interaction with h5py-backed masks and tiles is automatically handled through 
:class:`~pathml.core.h5manager._h5manager`, for example ``slidedata.tiles[atile]`` returns the tile at 
key atile from h5py on disk. Note that this command has syntax like an in-memory dict.

Hierarchical File System
------------------------

**h5path** utilizes a self-describing hierarchical file system that mirrors 
:class:`~pathml.core.slide_data`. This allows for simple reading and writing
of :class:`~pathml.core.slide_data` objects.

Here we examine the **h5path** file format:

* /root 
    * /fields  
        * ///name 
        * ///slide_backend 
        * ///history 
        * ///labels
    * //array 
    * /masks  
        * //arraymask1
    * /tiles 
        * //tilesdict
        * //tilemask1

Objects are saved to **h5path** if they are present in :class:`~pathml.core.slide_data`. 
The file system is organized through h5py.Groups. /root is a group, as are /fields, 
/masks, and /tiles. Groups are container-like and can be queried like dictionaries.

.. code-block::

   import h5py
   root = h5py.File('pathtoh5.h5', 'r')
   masks = root['masks']

Within groups, array-like objects are stored as h5py.Datasets that when accessed return 
numpy.ndArray objects. All tiles are stitched together in a single h5py.Dataset at //array.
A dict is maintained at //tilesdict with coordinates and fields describing each tile.
To retrieve a numpy.ndArray object from h5py.Datasets you must slice the Dataset with
NumPy fancy-indexing syntax: for example [...] to retrieve the full array, or [a:b, :] to
return the array with first dimension sliced to the interval [a, b].

.. code-block::

   import h5py
   root = h5py.File('pathtoh5.h5', 'r')
   masks = root['masks']
   segmentationmask = masks['segmentationmask'][...]
   segmentationmaskslice = segmentationmask[2,:,:]

Attributes are small named fields attached to h5py.Dataset and h5py.Group objects. String,
tuple, and dict type objects are stored as attributes of the Group or Dataset they describe.
///name and ///labels for SlideData are stored as attributes describing /fields.

.. code-block::

   import h5py
   root = h5py.File('pathtoh5.h5', 'r')
   tile = root['tiles']['tile1']
   tilecoords = tile.attrs['coords']

Reading and Writing
-------------------

:class:`~pathml.core.slide_data.SlideData` objects are easily written to **h5path** format
by calling :meth:`~pathml.core.slide_data.SlideData.write`.
All files with .h5 or .h5py extensions are loaded to SlideData objects automatically by calling
:func:`~pathml.core.h5path.read`.
