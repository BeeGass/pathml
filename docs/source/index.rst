Welcome to PathML's documentation!
==================================

``PathML`` is a python package for computational pathology.

``PathML`` provides a toolbox specifically designed to enable machine learning with high-resolution
whole-slide pathology images, including defining preprocessing pipelines, training and evaluating ML models,
benchmarking model performance on standardized datasets, sharing preprocessing pipelines and pretrained models,
and more.

Development is led by the AI Operations and Data Science Group in the Department of Informatics and Analytics at
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
