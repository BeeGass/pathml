Welcome to PathML's documentation!
==================================

``PathML`` is a Python package for computational pathology.

``PathML`` is a toolbox to facilitate machine learning workflows for high-resolution whole-slide pathology 
images. This includes modular pipelines for preprocessing, PyTorch DataLoaders for training and benchmarking 
machine learning model performance on standardized datasets, and support for sharing preprocessing pipelines, 
pretrained models, and more.

Development is a collaboration between the AI Operations and Data Science Group in the Department of Informatics 
and Analytics at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Weill 
Cornell Medicine.
