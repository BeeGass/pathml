Overview
========

``PathML`` is a toolkit supporting each step in the computational pathology research workflow:

By providing these tools, we aim to accelerate research, reduce barriers to entry for new researchers, and promote open science.

.. note::
    We provide pre-built tools, public datasets, and documentation to allow anyone with beginner proficiency in python to
    get started.

For advanced users, we provide a modular set of tools which can be composed into custom workflows, as well as complete
API documentation to enable implementation of new features or tools on top of ``PathML``.

Whether you want to get started quickly with pre-built tools and tutorials,
of if you want to mix-and-match components to design your own analysis pipelines,
or if you want to dig into the code and write completely custom extensions and new features -
``PathML`` has something for you!
