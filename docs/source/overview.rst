By providing these tools, we aim to accelerate research, reduce barriers to entry for new researchers, and promote open science.

.. note::
    We provide pre-built tools, public datasets, and documentation to allow anyone with beginner proficiency in python to
    get started.

For advanced users, we also provide extensive support for designing custom preprocessing pipelines and benchmarking
performance of new models.
