Pipeline Repository
===================

The PathML Pipeline Repository enables sharing of preprocessing pipelines.

``Pipeline`` objects can be written to disk, and the file can be uploaded to a central repository.
From the repository, other users of PathML are able to download files, load them into local copies of the Pipeline
objects, and run them on local data.

This has several benefits for the computational pathology research community:

- Facilitates collaboration
- Saves time
- Helps ensure reproducibility of methods
- Promotes open science

[update this section when we have settled on more details of implementation, have working examples]
