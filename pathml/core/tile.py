    """
    Object for representing a tile region extracted from an image. Holds the image for the tile, as well as the (i,j)
    coordinates of the top-left corner of the tile in the original image. The (i,j) coordinate system is based
    on labelling the top-leftmost pixel as (0, 0)

    name (str): name of tile
    masks (pathml.core.Masks): corresponding masks for region
    coords (tuple): Coordinates of tile relative to maximum resolution of whole-slide image.
        The (i,j) coordinate system is based on labelling the top-leftmost pixel as (0, 0)
    slidetype: type of image (e.g. pathml.HESlide). Defaults to None.
    labels: labels for the tile
